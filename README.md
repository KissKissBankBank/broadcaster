# Broadcaster
## Motivations and principles
Broadcaster is an engine keeping track of your user's publications campaigns and subscriptions. Each publication campaign should belong to a publisher, and each subscription should belong to a subscriber.

The subscriber will therefore have access to the publication campaigns he / she has subscribed to, through its subscriptions.

Any subscription is accessible via a unique `unsubscribe_token`, and can be deactivated (or reactivated).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'broadcaster'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install broadcaster

On a rails application, execute `rake db:migrate` to create the broadcaster tables.

Then include the following modules to plug `Broadcaster::Subscription` or `Broadcaster::Campaign` to any publisher or subscriber:
```rb
class MyPublisher
  include Broadcaster::Publisher

  ...
end
```
```rb
class MySubscriber
  include Broadcaster::Subscriber

  ...
end
```

## Usage
Access a publisher's `publication_campaigns`:
```rb
my_publisher = MyPublisher.find(...)

my_publisher.publication_campaigns
# => [#<Broadcaster::Campaign ...>, ...]
```

Or a subscriber's `subscriptions`:
```rb
my_subscriber = MySubscriber.find(...)

my_subscriber.subscriptions
# => [#<Broadcaster::Subscription ...>, ...]
```

Access the subscriptions of a campaign:
```rb
campaign = Broadcaster::Campaign.find(...)

subscriptions = campaign.subscriptions
active_subscriptions = campaign.subscriptions.active
```

Given a subscription, access its publication campaign:
```rb
subscription = Broadcaster::Subscription.find(...)

subscription.broadcaster_campaign
```

Deactivate a subscription:
```rb
subscription = Broadcaster::Subscription.find(...)

subscription.deactivate
```

Or activate a subscription:
```rb
subscription = Broadcaster::Subscription.find(...)

subscription.activate
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. Create the broadcaster tables with `bundle exec rake db:create`, then `bundle exec rake db:migrate` to launch the migrations. Run `bundle exec rspec spec` to run the tests.

To test the plugged engine, move to `cd spec/dummy` and create the user table with `bundle exec rake db:migrate`. Run `rails c` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

To ensure specs and linter validity, before opening your pull request run `$ safepush test lint push open`
